--  Class inheritance is a way for one class to extend another class. So we can create new functionality on top of the existing.

--  We can use the extends keyword while defining a Child class that inherits from Parent. can you give example

// Parent class
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

// Child class that inherits from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call the constructor of the parent class
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks. It's a ${this.breed}.`);
  }
}

// Create instance
const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Labrador");

myDog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks. It's a Labrador.

extends: Used to inherit from the parent class.

super(): Calls the constructor of the parent class.

Method overriding: Dog overrides the speak method of Animal
