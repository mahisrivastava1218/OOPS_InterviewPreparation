A constructor is a special function (or method) that is used to initialize objects when they are created.
Its main job is to set up the initial values (properties) of the object.
In ES5 (before classes), we used constructor functions.
In ES6 and later, we use the constructor method inside a class.
Called automatically when a new object is created with new.
Usually used to set initial properties of the object.


Example in ES6 class
class Car {
  constructor(brand, color) {  // constructor method
    this.brand = brand;
    this.color = color;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`${this.color} ${this.brand}`);
  }
}

const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Red"); // constructor runs here
car1.displayInfo(); // Red Toyota

Example in Constructor Function (ES5 style)
function Car(brand, color) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.color = color;
}

const car1 = new Car("BMW", "Black"); // constructor runs here
console.log(car1.brand); // BMW

A constructor is like the setup worker â€” whenever you create a new object, the constructor is called to give that object its starting values.
