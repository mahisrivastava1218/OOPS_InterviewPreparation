1. What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint or template that describes how something should be structured.
It defines properties (data) and methods (behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.

Think of it as a plan, not the actual thing.

2. What is an Object?
An object is a real-world instance of a class.
It is created (or "instantiated") from the class and has actual values in place of the properties defined in the class.

3. Real-world Example
Let’s take Car as the example.

Class: Car
Properties (attributes):

brand

color

speed

Methods (actions):

start()

stop()

accelerate()

This is just the idea of what a car is — no actual car yet.

Objects (Actual Cars)
From the Car class, we can create different objects:

car1

brand: "Toyota"

color: "Red"

speed: 0

Methods: start(), stop(), accelerate()

car2

brand: "BMW"

color: "Black"

speed: 0

Methods: start(), stop(), accelerate()

4. In JavaScript:
// Class definition
class Car {
  constructor(brand, color) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.color = color;
    this.speed = 0;
  }

  start() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} is starting...`);
  }

  accelerate(amount) {
    this.speed += amount;
    console.log(`${this.brand} is now going at ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }
}

// Creating objects from the class
const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Red");
const car2 = new Car("BMW", "Black");

car1.start();        // Toyota is starting...
car1.accelerate(50); // Toyota is now going at 50 km/h

car2.start();        // BMW is starting...
Class = Design / Blueprint

Object = Real thing made from the blueprint
